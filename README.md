# Tip && Tricks
## For the JR Dev in your life.
**Literally** every thing below is IMHO




### Pro Tip Numero Uno

__HANDS OFF THE F*&^%ING MOUSE!!!__

As a developer your time is a __Super Valuable Resource__...

So every little thing you can do to increase efficiency will pay vast dividends over the course of your career.

You rarely need to actually touch the mouse. Every time you do you must take your hands complete off the keyboard. Grab the mouse. Go click the thing, then transfer back to the keyboard, find the home-row and finally start typing again...Precious seconds that add up to a huge savings.

Turns out ```⌘ p``` is the fastest way to get around a working directory.

### Follow the Golden Rule of BLOCKS
As soon as you __OPEN__ the block __CLOSE__ the block.
```ruby

def thing_func

end

thingy.each do

end

{ }

[ ]

```

### Code readability BEATS conciseness 10.times out of 10
This means writing functions that are easy for developers to read. Not just you, but the people that maintain your code down the road.

## Chrome Extensions

```⌘+\``` is what I use.

Also.... Use iTerm2 instead of terminal.
